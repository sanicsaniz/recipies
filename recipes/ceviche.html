    <p>Enhanced with diced tomatoes, red onions, and cilantro, this ceviche is a harmonious blend of textures and colors, creating a feast for both the eyes and palate. The subtle heat from finely chopped jalapeños adds a tantalizing kick, while a pinch of sea salt ties everything together, enhancing the natural flavors of the ingredients.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound (about 450 grams) of fresh seafood (shrimp, fish, or a combination), cleaned and diced into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>1/2 cup red onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
        <li>1-2 jalapeños, seeded and finely chopped (adjust according to your spice preference)</li>
        <li>1 cup lime juice (about 8-10 limes)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup lemon juice (about 2 lemons)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: Avocado slices for serving</li>

    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a non-reactive bowl (glass or stainless steel), combine the diced seafood, cherry tomatoes, red onion, cilantro, and jalapeños.</li>
        
        <li>Pour the lime and lemon juice over the mixture, ensuring all the ingredients are well-coated. The citrus juices "cook" the seafood by denaturing the proteins, giving it a cooked texture without heat.</li>
        
        <li>Add salt to taste and gently toss the ingredients together.</li>
        
        <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour, allowing the flavors to meld and the seafood to marinate.</li>
        
        <li>During this time, you'll notice the seafood turning opaque and firm, indicating it's ready.</li>
        
        <li>Before serving, taste and adjust the seasoning if needed. You can also add avocado slices for a creamy contrast.</li>
        
        <li>Serve the Zesty Citrus Ceviche chilled, either as an appetizer with tortilla chips or as a light meal on its own. Enjoy the burst of freshness with every bite!</li>
      </ol>
